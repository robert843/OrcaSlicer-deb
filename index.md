title: Handle your AWS Spot Instance Actions with terminate-notice
---
You're running AWS Spot Instances, and suddenly your monitoring system notices
that the spot instances are being terminated without workloads being
effectively moved to another instance. How can we fix this?

AWS create an entry in the Metadata Service which the node can watch for. This
script polls that Metadata entry, and if it finds it, it runs any responding
scripts to cleanly move services elsewhere.

## How to Install?

### Individually

Get the latest release from [terminate-notice/terminate-notice](
https://github.com/terminate-notice/terminate-notice/releases/latest)

You will also need to install the appropriate actions, which are available from:

* [terminate-notice/terminate-notice-announce](
  https://github.com/terminate-notice/terminate-notice-announce/releases/latest)
* [terminate-notice/terminate-notice-datadog](
  https://github.com/terminate-notice/terminate-notice-datadog/releases/latest)
* [terminate-notice/terminate-notice-slack](
  https://github.com/terminate-notice/terminate-notice-slack/releases/latest)
* [terminate-notice/terminate-notice-shutdown](
  https://github.com/terminate-notice/terminate-notice-shutdown/releases/latest)

### Add a Debian Repository

Download the [public key](terminate-notice.gpg) and put it in
`/etc/apt/keyrings/terminate-notice.gpg`. You can achieve this with:

```
wget -qO- {{ site.url }}/terminate-notice.asc | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/terminate-notice.asc >/dev/null
```

Next, create the source in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/`

```
echo "deb [arch=all signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/terminate-notice.asc] {{ site.url }}/deb stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/terminate-notice.list >/dev/null
```

Then run `apt update && apt install -y` followed by the names of the packages you want to install.

### Add a RPM Repository

Download the repo file `cd /etc/yum.repos.d ; curl {{ site.url }}/terminate-notice.repo -LO`

Then you can do `yum install -y` followed by the names of the packages you want to install.

### The packages you can install

Currently these are:

* terminate-notice
* terminate-notice-announce
* terminate-notice-datadog
* terminate-notice-shutdown
* terminate-notice-slack

## After installing the packages

You should configure settings that are installed into `/etc/terminate-notice.conf.d/` and then run

```
systemctl enable --now terminate-notice.service
```
